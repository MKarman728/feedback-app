#Feedback App

This is a simple feedback app that takes in client feedback along with rating information and displays it below.

The deployed project can be found at: https://stirring-rabanadas-9f3093.netlify.app

Currently, this uses the following technology: 
- React JS to control state
- UUID to generate IDs for each feedback item
- CSS for styling
-json-server for backend to store feedback data inputted by users.
